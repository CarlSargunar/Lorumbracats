This is just me getting to grips with creating an umbraco package using the awesome Package Workshop from the Candid Contributions Hackathon 2020

## Getting Started Guide

 - Clone the repo 
 - Open Visual Studio 2019 in Administrator mode
 - Do stuff


For this package, I've allowed the Website package in for testing purposes, normally you may not want to include the test website, but it seems sensible to me. I've committed the database too, as it's just SQL CE

## Credentials 

Username : admin@local.com

Password : LetMeIn0017$
